# Lesson 10: Understanding how to read analog voltage using analog read command
## Set-up:
The set up is like question 2 in Lesson 9 problems:
+ Probe a wire from the point where you want to read the signal.
+ Connect this wire to the Analog in side (A0 - A5)
![Physical setup](images/img1.png)

Run the code given and open the serial monitor by clicking on the search button located on top right.
![Measured output in the searial monitor](images/img2.png)

We can see that the measured voltage is very close to the calculated voltage from the previous lesson
