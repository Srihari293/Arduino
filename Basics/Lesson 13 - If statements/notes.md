# Lesson 13: Understanding if statements
We will use the potentiometer setup from lesson 12 in this lesson.

## What are if statements?
These are statements only when a condition is satisfied

In this set-up we will turn the LED light on when the voltage output from v2 is greater than 4V
![Voltage greater than 4](images/img2.png)

We can also have compound statements like 
+ && - AND
+ || - OR
+ ~ - Not
+ = - Assignment operator
+ == - Check if equal (Conditional operator)
+ != - Check if not equal
+ <em>><em> - Greater than 
+ < - Less than 
+ <em>>=<em> - Greater than or equal to 
+ <= - Less than or equal to 

# Homework: Create a warning mechanism.
When the voltage is less than 3 the device is safe to use.
When the voltage is between 3 and 4 its overheating. When voltage is greater than 4, its is hazardous. 

*Hint: Use LEDs*
