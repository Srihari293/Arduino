// Lesson 5: Working with binary numbers
// Computers look at things are true or false i.e On or off i.e 1 or 0.
// Numbers, letters, words, colors and music can all be represented by numbers, binary numbers in particular.
// Micro-controllers have billions of switches that can represent a series of 0's and 1's

// How do we count?
// 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Oh wait we have used all characters, so we reuse the character to create the next number, 10. 
// But coutning more than 2 digits require way more characters to count. Therefore we use binary numbers to represent numbers
