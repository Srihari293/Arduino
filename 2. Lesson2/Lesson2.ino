// Lesson 2: Light and LED

// How does a traditional light bulb work?
// Electricity --> Resistance --> Heat --> Red hot --> White hot --> Light
// Issue: 
// -- Resistors are heat emitting device, not a light emitting ones. 
// -- Therefore there is a lot of heat in the room is a waste of electricity. 
// -- To cool this heat off we use A.C which is also a waste of electricity. 

// So what is the solution?
// Before we look at that, lets revisit semiconductor devices first.

// Solid state physics:
// Conductors - Conducts electricity
// Insulator - Does not conducts electricity
// Semi-conductors - Can be both conducting and insulating based on the electrical signals passed into it. Can be tailored.

// Note: The Arduino itself has small chips of silicon wafers which are essentially semiconductor material. Everything is based on semi-conductors
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
