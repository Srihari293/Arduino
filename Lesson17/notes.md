# Lesson 17: While loops
While loops are another kind of loop that is just as good as the for loop *while* (no pun intended) offering more flexibility. 

While loops tend to run till the condition for the loop is met. They have the initialization steep outside the loop and the update step inside the loop.

In the excercise for this lesson we will issue a warning when voltage consumed is more than 2.5 using a red LED and potentiometer.
