# Lesson 6: 4 bit binary counter
## This solution to this is given in Lesson 5 homework
## Troubleshooting:
The main take away from this exercise is troubleshooting techniques. We could go wrong in many places like hardware, wiring or coding. But the most common errors are:
- Electrical:
    + connecting the wires in the wrong slot
    + shorting the circuit
    + broken wire or burn't LED

- Software:
    + Most of them get caught by the IDE even before they can get uploaded to the hardware
    + Need of delay time for perceiving change 
    + Logical errors. These are silent errors and are hard to spot. Always write the algorithm and pseudocode before writing the main code
