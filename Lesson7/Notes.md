# Lesson 7: Analog write
Analog write is used to set specific values. Digital write has only 2 modes (High/low), while analog write has an 8bit resolution to set the output.

Syntax: analogWrite(pin,[0,255])

Unlike digtal write only some of the pins work for analog write. They must have the ~ symbol before it.
